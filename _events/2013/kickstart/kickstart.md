### Kit Delivery

We expect that the majority of teams will be able to collect their kits
at Kickstart. Alternatively, you can arrange for it to be collected by
courier during the week following. Couriered kits should be insured for
Â£500, please [contact us](mailto:info@studentrobotics.org) for collection
details.

If you think that you will have difficulty doing this (e.g: overseas teams),
then please let us know in advance. We are able to assist a limited number
of teams with shipping if you are unable to collect them at Kickstart.
