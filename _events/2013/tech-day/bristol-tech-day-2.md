**Who:** All Student Robotics teams are welcome to attend. Please [inform](/about/contactus) us if your team is coming.

**Food:** There are a number of caf√©s opposite the [Wills Memorial building](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/conferences-hospitality/conferences/precinct/willsmemorial), which is about a 2 minute walk. Alternatively, the city centre shops are about a 4 minute walk from the Merchant Venturers building.

**Kit:** We usually organise guest logons for all attendees for the University's own CentOS Linux machines. Schools are, however, welcome to bring their own laptops if they prefer - guest logons for Eduroam can be provided.
